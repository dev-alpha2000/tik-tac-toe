## Overview

This project is a Tic Tac Toe Game built using React. It is a simple two-player game where playe## rs take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three of their marks either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally before their opponent.

## Features

Two-Player Gameplay: Play alternates between two players (X and O).

Game Logic: The game detects a winner or a tie based on the current game state.

Restart Option: Players can reset the board to start a new game after a win or a tie.

Responsive Design: The game is playable on both desktop and mobile devices with a simple and clean interface.
